How to use log handler in your code
=================================== -->

Templates provided during service creation contains all the required logging utils. Logs generated by your code are shipped to a centralized location (Splunk). Detailed steps on how to access your logs are provided [here]({{< ref "logs.md" >}}).
This article explains how to use the logging utility (handler) in your code.Â 

### Runtime: NodeJs

1.  **Include the logging util at the start of your code**

    > const logger = require("./components/logger.js");

2.  **Initialize logger at the start of your function**

    >  // initialize logger module

    > logger.init(event, context);

3.  **Start using the logger in your function**

    >  // your log statements can go like this..

    > logger.error('Runtime errors or unexpected conditions.');

    >  logger.warn('Runtime situations that are undesirable or unexpected,
        but not necessarily "wrong".');

    >  logger.info('Interesting runtime events (Eg. connection
        established, data fetched etc.)');

    >  logger.verbose('Generally speaking, most lines logged by your
        application should be written as verbose.');

    > logger.debug('Detailed information on the flow through the
    > system.');

### Runtime: Java

1.  **Import the Logger class**

    > import org.apache.log4j.Logger;

2.  **Initialize logger**

    >  // initialize logger object at the beginning of your class class

    >  static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(RequestHandler.class);

3.  **Start using the logger in your class**

    >  // your log statements can go like this..

    >  logger.trace("Finer-grained informational events than the DEBUG
        ");

    >  logger.info("Interesting runtime events (Eg. connection
        established, data fetched etc.)");

    >  logger.warn("Runtime situations that are undesirable or unexpected,
        but not necessarily ""wrong"".");

    > logger.debug("Detailed information on the flow through the
        system.");

    > logger.error("Runtime errors or unexpected conditions.");

    > logger.fatal("Very severe error events that will presumably lead the
    > application to abort");

### Runtime: Python

1.  **Import the logger module**

    > from components.logger import Logger

2.  **Initialize logger at the start of your function**

    >  \# initialize logger module

    > logger = Logger(event, context)

3.  **Start using the logger in your code**

    >  \# your log statements can go like this..

    >  logger.error('Runtime errors or unexpected conditions.')

    >  logger.warn('Runtime situations that are undesirable, but not
        wrong')

    >  logger.info('Interesting runtime events eg. connection
        established)')

    >  logger.verbose('Generally speaking, most log lines should be
        verbose')

    > logger.debug('Detailed information on the flow through the system.')
