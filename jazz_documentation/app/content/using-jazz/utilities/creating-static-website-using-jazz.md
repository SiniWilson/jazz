# Supported Frameworks

As of today, Jazz can deploy to T-Mobile's Apigee SaaS platform. We're working hard to get this integration going to support more features including integration with Apigee platform hosted on-premises.

To change service **runtime** for an existing service, follow the steps below:

- Login into [Jazz](https://jazz.corporate.t-mobile.com/) and select a service from the list.

- In the overview tab, click on the 'Edit' Button in the top left.

- Select the target runtime from the list of available runtimes.

- Click on 'Save' button. A confirmation pop-up will appear. Upon confirmation, the service runtime will be updated in the catalog.

All future deployments to your service will be using the updated runtime.

*Note: If you need your service to get updated immediately, you'll need to manually trigger a deployment for each environment. Simply, go to the 'Deployments' tab for an environment and click 'Build Now' button to trigger a new deployment!*
