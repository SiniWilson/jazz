## Overview

Majority of the managed services that you use in Serverless follow pay-per-use cost model. It is quite important, especially in pay-per-use model, to keep track of the cost of your cloud infrastructure to avoid runaway costs.

Jazz brings you the ability to explore the costs of the serverless infrastructure that you create using Jazz! We've integrated Jazz with other cloud tools to show these cost details within Jazz UI. You can get cost for last 7 days, last month, last 6 months or an year!

Currently, you can browse the cost details at the following levels -

- [Service](#service)
- [Environment](#environment)
- [Asset Type](#asset-type)
- [Asset](#asset)
