What is a Jazz Service, Namespaces & Environments
================================================== -->

If you are using AWS to deploy your APIs, functions or websites, AWS CloudWatch automatically collects and tracks metrics for your components. Jazz provides extensive support for monitoring your services directly from the dashboard. Depending on your service types, it shows different metrics for each service. For example, if you have developed an API, you can see API Latency, 4XX/5XX errors etc. For a website, you can see metrics like RequestCount, BytesUploaded/Downloaded, 4XX/5XX error counts etc.

Jazz's Metrics tab will be available per environment like shown below.
